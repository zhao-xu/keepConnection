A modified version of Oracle SQLDeveloper KeepConnected.  
Origin version can be found at [https://sites.google.com/site/keepconnext/](https://sites.google.com/site/keepconnext/).  

* Remove annoying popups.

###Compile
1. Execute `get-libs.sh` to copy dependencies.
2. Compile. Sorry, no script here.
3. Execute `deploy.sh` if you are using IntelliJ and your SQLDeveloper happen to installed under /Applications.
   Otherwise, read the file, it's just a simple packing script.
